<p style="text-align:center;">The ideal job for me is to be an ICT Support Officer. The position is only a 6-month contract; however, I am looking at this job or similar roles with more permanent positions. There were none available when I was looking through job listings so this is the closest, I could find. The role asks that the employee hired is responsible for managing and maintaining the ICT systems of the New South Wales government agency. Whilst I currently live in Melbourne, I have many friends who live in NSW and would not mind the change of residential address. The role asks for Installation and maintenance of the organizations ICT network. This involves the oversight of Information and Communication Technology that is used to connect the organization with their patrons. The job listing also asks that any issues that arise with the organizations ICT systems is handled and fixed by the person or people given the role. This job appeals to me as there is a wide range of technical support that goes into an organization of this size. They ask that multiple different tasks be done, and this would give me different experiences across a wide range of situations. I also am interested in the roleâ€™s connectedness with the rest of the organization as I am a person who enjoys meeting new people and developing personal connections in the workplace. The support given from the ICT Support Officer in the organization would allow me to meet lots of people in the organization, whether they are part of the ICT team or not, whilst working in a field suited to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The requirements for the position of ICT Support Officer include at least 2 years of experience in a technical support role. Knowledge of Windows Server Administration. The Employee would need to be confident in the use of OneDrive, SharePoint and Office 365. The employee, as a supporting role in the organization would need to understand and identify network and server issues while also being able to provide and advise members of the organization on solutions to any issues that arise. The ICT Support Officer also needs to understand scripting basics, and system configuration of the organizations network and equipment. This would include maintenance, instillation and development of the organizations technology systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Whilst previously stated, I have no formal qualifications yet. I do however have experience supporting an organization in the IT field as more of a background member of my current workplaces IT department. They have asked me previously to give support based on my own informal qualifications. I am familiar with the use of OneDrive and have had experience in explaining, advising and solving technical issues that have arisen in my workplace throughout the 4 years working there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The plan to gain the formal qualifications is to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology to gain an understanding of systems administration, and many of the technological issues that could arise in a workplace such as this. If there were any outstanding skills that need obtaining for the position, I would be more than happy to take up extra courses whilst gaining experience in the IT industry to meet the 2-year quota that the position is asking for. This could be an entry level ICT support job working under an ICT Support Officer to gain the experience I need and would be relevant to the career opportunity I have chosen.</p>
