<h1 style="text-align:center;">Project Ideas</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Overveiw</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">The project I have decided to present is a video streaming and sharing community discussion board built as a desktop app called GitGud (name is placeholder). The central focus of this app will around gaming with coaching and competitive esports side of online gaming as a priority. GitGud will be focused on helping people boost their gaming to a competitive level as there are no current apps that focus on the demographic of people looking to make it into the esports scene. People will use GitGud as an app to meet coaches and other likeminded gamers in order to set up personalized training or find players of their favorite games in order to learn and boost their skill levels. This will help them to climb ranks or in certain cases even gain a foothold on the esports scene.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Motivation</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">The motivation for GitGud is around the difficulty in making it into the esports field. Whilst it is unreasonable that everyone could make it into global level events for their favorite games, teams and competitions are still going on in a local setting for people. There is nothing in the current market for people who are looking to gain training and coaching for a competitive environment in a similar way that there are to the more traditional sporting events. GitGud is an app for the people who dream of becoming the best they can be and whilst online coaching for games does exist, it is not readily accessible and is quite difficult to navigate as multiple apps and websites are used in preparation of one training session. GitGud aims to eliminate all this difficulty and bring the thrill of competition to a more convenient and accessible desktop application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Description</h2>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Video Streaming</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">The predominant feature of GitGud is the ability for video streaming and commentary. Coaches who are professionals or ex-professionals of specific games will be able to stream on their coach specific profiles for users with subscriptions to watch and comment on through a live chat system.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Live Chat System</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">The live chat system will allow users who are watching a particular coach streaming to comment on their video communicate with one another and ask questions. The coach will have the ability to mute, kick and ban any users out of the chat if they are being offensive or spamming the chat. They will also be able to designate certain trusted users as their moderators so that they can focus on the content while the moderators take care of chat etiquette.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Subscription</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">Players will be able to subscribe to specific coaches that they enjoy for $5 a month (price liable to change) similar in price to other subscription services. This would allow them to see all coaching sessions that the coach puts out, whilst personalized coaching whether that be in teams or in 1on1 sessions could be paid for by session. The coach will be able to determine these prices as this would be a time commitment from them. A small percentage of the subscription will be taken as an upkeep and continued development cost for GitGud as a service.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Coaching</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">Coaches will be able to sign up with a login that must be certified through resume. If the coach has a record of doing well in high level competition, they will be allowed to become a coach for GitGud. This will not be a time constrained application as often people who used to compete in high level competition want to become coaches after their competitive career. The coachâ€™s payment for their content will be paid through the subscription service and will be given most of the subscription money given to them. Users will be able to get in touch with coaches they have subscribed too through a message system similar to the friends list messaging and will have a block user setting to prevent harassment or spam.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Coaches Profile</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">Coaches will have a personalized profile with username and password protection, that allows them to stream and video share freely in order to make the content that they wish to use as coaching material. </p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">User Profile</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">The community of users in GitGud will be able to login and save their preferences under a profile with username and password protection. The users profiles will have progression system and friends list which will be expanded upon in their descriptions.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Catalogue of games</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">GitGud will have games sorted into genres and coaches grouped under specific games. This will give users an easy-to-use search system with the ability to look for games and coaching that they enjoy.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Progression</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">For people wishing to structure their training and gaming, there will be a progression tracker. This will have a simple calendar system as not to overload the users, whilst having an entry system where certain days can have entries and set to daily, weekly or monthly. This will help users track their training while also being a useful area to list upcoming tournaments they wish to participate in or attend.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Friends List</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">The community will be able to come together and form competitive teams using a friends list. This will allow messaging from one person to another provided they are friends. Based on community feedback this could be expanded to having open messages between non-friends as well.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Report System</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">If users are being abusive or offending the community through unethical use of the friends list chat then an option to report users based on these accusations will be available. The reports will be looked at by moderators (those in charge of GitGud) and determined if the user is given a warning. 2 warnings will have a user given a 24-hour ban. 3 Will have their account locked unless an appeal to the moderators is made and approved.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">The tools and technologies that need to go into a program like this would include something to organize and videos such as RTMP. There would need to be a written code that would allow videos to be shared with viewers. C++ is used as code in a lot of video sharing companies such as twitch to provide streaming to their viewers. There is an open-source program called pubsub which allows messages to be sent through a chat feature with a publisher (or coach in this case) as the controller of the chat feed. This would be ideal for a desktop app such as GitGud.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Skills Required</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">The skills required to make this project a reality would be desktop application development. I will need to learn how to create a desktop app and create a website where users could download it. This would involve learning HTML for the website that users could download the app. Learning a coding language such as C++ would also be very useful as it would allow me to write code that can set up the program the way I need to format it and let users have a smooth experience when using GitGud. Understanding how to set barriers on programs would allow me to make my software secure and is crucial if people are using their bank accounts in transactions for subscriptions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Outcome</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">The outcome of GitGud will solve the issues of the esports industry being such a difficult area for people to gain a foothold in. This is an especially large problem for areas outside of Korea, Japan, China and North America, as these places have the larges esports followings and teams becoming part of a team is exceptionally difficult for people from outside those areas. GitGud will bring coaching and an easily accessible competitive environment to the wider public making a more globally inclusive esports scene a reality. It will also benefit the people who want to play in more local competition as they will have access to the best coaches and competitors in the game all on one application. Instead of needing to use multiple applications to boost their gaming skill and potential career they will be able to access all the coaching and support in one place with one application.</p>
