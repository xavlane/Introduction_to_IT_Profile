<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">After leaving my teaching course I started to become interested in the IT industry, as many of my friends are a part of the industry. I waited some time before making a commitment to study as I felt I went into teaching to hastily. However, over a couple of years looking into IT and the friends who were working in the industry I decided to take the steps to joining the industry and enroll in a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I do not have any formal experience in IT; however, I do take an interest in IT and work very closely with the IT coordinator at the school I work at, who often comes to me with questions of how to do certain tasks. Whilst I have no formal experience, I am not going to be discouraged by this because I am determined to have a formal education in the IT industry. I am aiming to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology and I am very excited to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I chose RMIT because I had heard good things about them. They were also offering a course that suited my needs. RMIT is often talked about in very high regards, so when I was looking to enter a course to get the qualifications I wanted, RMIT was the first place I looked at. I decided to enroll in RMIT with a friend which made an exciting experience out of the enrollment procedure.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">During my studies in RMIT, I hope to learn about coding and the fundamentals of the IT industry. I am currently enrolled in two courses that are really suited to what I hope to learn. The first being Introduction to Information Technology and the second being Introduction to Programming. These are the first two courses I am completing on my way to obtaining a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
