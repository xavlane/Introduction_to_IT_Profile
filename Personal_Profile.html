<h1 style="text-align:center;">Personal Profile</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Personality Test</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">According to the Myers-Briggs personality test at <a href="www.16personalities.com"> (Introduction | Mediator (INFP) Personality | 16Personalities, 2021)</a> my personality style is that of the mediator (INFPs). People with these personality traits are people who respond with a strong connection to music and art. They are sensitive, creative and imaginative and who often create stories in their heads about the world around them. Mediators are often empathetic and look to help others. The mediator personality type often feels alone and lost in their lives as they are always looking to help others but rarely is someone of the same personality type looking to help them in the same way. Mediators are empathetic and generous, with a caring and open-minded personality. The downsides to the mediator personality type are that they are often unrealistic in their ideals and tend to self-isolate, which is a leading factor in their feelings of loneliness. The mediator personality is also quite self-critical of their achievements, and this causes them to feel lost and as though they are not achieving the things, they care want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The results of this test are quite accurate to me as a person. I often think of others more than I think of myself and am always looking to solve other people’s problems before my own. This is often because I am very critical of myself and feel as though I am not good enough at whatever I am doing. I look to solve other people’s problems as trying to solve my own often makes me feel inadequate and that I am failing at what I am trying to achieve. In a group setting this may lead me to be more than ready to help the people I work with at a moments notice, however when I need help, I may be reluctant to ask in order to maintain my confidence and hope that I can solve the issue on my own. Inevitably this could lead to a lot of self-doubt and concern about my own abilities to complete the tasks required of me. When looking for a team I should try and find people who similarly want to help others as this will support me when I am reluctant to ask. I should also look for people who are offering help and are confident in their abilities so that when we are working together there is not too much self-criticism in the team that the entire team is not confident about the project that we are working on.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Learning Style Test</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Taking a learning style test with <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/"> (Tactile/Kinesthetic Learner, 2021)</a> gave me the result of a tactile/kinesthetic style of learning. Study tips for people of this learning style include physical activity during your study, listening to music and studying in short bursts with frequent breaks. There is evidence to support these tactics for study as physicality is the primary attribute of a tactile learning style. People who learn this way often learn by having physical objects or activities that will distract their body while their brain is active as an urge to fidget is a constant battle for this learning type to deal with. Music playing in the background as people with this learning style study also alleviates this urge to fidget as with the distraction of music helps focus the mind on the task at hand and gives the person something that they can quickly shift their focus between. These options being music and study. Another option for study is to take breaks regularly as the urge to fidget will become an inevitable distraction if not dealt with. The use of regular breaks in study allows the person to leave and come back to study with a refreshed focus as mental fatigue is a common occurrence for people of this learning style.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This test is an accurate portrayal of me as a student. I need to understand that I often lose focus and fidget when I am trying to concentrate. I need to use the strategies laid out in this test as ways to regain my focus and work in an efficient manner. When I am looking for a group this should be something I am aware of and that I will need to inform my team on. Working in bursts is my best course of action as I do feel a noticeable difference when I am losing focus. Taking a break for a short time in order to refresh my mental energy works for me and leads me to getting the most out of my study and work sessions. If I have a group who works similarly to me then we can schedule breaks for the team around similar times so that we are on the same timetable and are all coming back ready to work and participate in a group.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Creativity Test</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Taking a creativity test with <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/">(How Creative Are You?:, 2021)</a> I was given a score of 48. This score indicates that as a creative person I am coming up with ideas but giving up on them and not following through to their fullest potential. This test gave me an idea that when I am being creative, I need to look at what it is that I am pursuing, and I need to focus and follow through even if there are problems that get in the way of completion. There is a need to share and express my ideas with the people around me so that I can get feedback and discuss issues that arise in order to push past them for the sake of the project that I am working on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Whilst this test has a feeling of simplicity to it, I feel that this was a crucial test to take. The assignments given to me focus around presenting a project. The creative aspect of this is a definite factor when working in a group setting. I need to realize that when issues arise, I often lose confidence as outlined by my personality test results. The creativity test supports this claim and I need to work on my ability to ask for help and come to others with my concerns. When I form a group to work with, I should be looking for people who are willing to offer help and participate in shared work. When I am in a group I will need to focus on the ideas that I have and work towards completing them even when there are problems that need solving.</p>
